  ttl:
    name: Time to live
    description: >-
      Defaults to 300 seconds. Longer TTLs speed up DNS lookups by increasing the chance of cached results, but a longer TTL also means that updates to your records take longer to go into effect. You can choose a TTL between 30 seconds and 1 day. For more information, see [Cloudflare's TTL documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/ttl/).
