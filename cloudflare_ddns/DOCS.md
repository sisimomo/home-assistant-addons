# Home Assistant Add-on: Cloudflare DDNS

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Find the "Cloudflare DDNS" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## Configuration

The configuration keys are identical to the [configuration of Cloudflare DDNS](https://github.com/timothymiller/cloudflare-ddns#-authentication-methods).
Please get the meaning for them from there.
It's normal that the structure of the addon differs from the official config file, this is nessesary because of the Supervisor Addon config structure.
